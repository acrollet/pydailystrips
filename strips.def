# Comic strip download configuration file!
#
# Whitespace on both sides of each line is ignored, so indentation
# is only for human purposes.  Lines whose first real char is a hash
# will be ignored (ie: comments). 
#
# A "strip" stanza with all options defined looks like:
#
# strip foo
#    name Comic Foo
#    artist Artist Name
#    homepage http://www.foo.com/
#    searchpage http://www.foo.com/current/
#    searchpattern img src="(/comic/\d+\.png)"
#    baseurl http://imgs.foo.com
#    width 900
#    extra_txt Title Text|title="(.*?)"
#    extra_img Other Image|img src="(/other/\d+\.png)"
#    onhold
# end
#
# Any trailing whitespace on the "searchpattern" or "extra_*"
# lines will NOT be stripped, since that might actually be part
# of the pattern you are trying to match.
#
# Required fields are: name, homepage, searchpattern.
#
# Field definitions:
#
#   name (required)
#       The english name of the strip.  Will be printed above the
#       comic image.  Also used as the name of the directory to store
#       images in, when downloading.
#
#   artist
#       Artist name(s), just used when printing the comic header in
#       the HTML output.
#
#   homepage (required)
#       Homepage of the strip, will be used in the link on the
#       comic header.
#
#   searchpage
#       The page to actually search for the comic in.  If unspecified,
#       this will default to the homepage.
#
#   searchpattern (required)
#       This is the regex used to find the strip inside the searchpage.
#       The regex must contain at least one group (using parentheses),
#       and the result will be taken from the first group.  (Having more
#       than one is pointless, since we only look at the first, though
#       there's nothing stopping you from having as many as you like.)
#
#   baseurl
#       Prefix to append to the results found by searchpattern.  By
#       default this is a blank string, so if you don't specify baseurl,
#       the searchpattern's group should match a fully-qualified URL.
#       The magic string $homepage can be used, to specify that the
#       homepage should be used as the base URL.
#
#   width
#       On output, when downloading, the main comic image will be
#       told to appear at this width.  Currently just used for Diesel
#       Sweeties, since its image is far larger than any other comic
#       I use, so it seems out of place otherwise.  The image itself
#       is not resized in any way; it's just told to be this width
#       in HTML.
#
#   extra_txt
#       This is most commonly used to find "title text" attached to
#       an image.  This is pipe-delimited - the lefthand side will
#       be the label, and the righthand side is another regex to match.
#       This will be displayed below the main comic.  You can specify
#       as many of these as you like, and they will appear in the order
#       they're defined in.
#
#   extra_img
#       This is a method to load a secondary image alongside the main
#       comic.  It is pipe-delimited - the lefthand side will
#       be the label, and the righthand side is another regex to match.
#       The image will have the main "baseurl" prepended to it - there is
#       currently no way to use a different baseurl between the main comic
#       and any extras.  This will also ignore the "width" option.
#       This will be displayed below the main comic.  You can specify
#       as many of these as you like, and they will appear in the order
#       they're defined in.  Currently only used for SMBC Comics, which
#       has a second graphic called the "votey."
#
#   onhold
#       This will prevent the comic from being displayed if it hasn't
#       changed since the previous strip.  This is intended to be used
#       for strips which update very infrequently, or are on temporary
#       hold for an extended period of time.  This way pydailystrips
#       still checks for updates but doesn't clutter the index page
#       with the same strip day after day.
#
# A "group" stanza looks like this:
#
# group frotz
#     strip1
#     strip2
#     strip3
#     ...
# end
#
# Each entry in the group should correspond to the ID of the strips
# specified after the "strip" directive.
#
# NOTE: A strip with an ID of "end" cannot be set as part of a group!
#
# NOTE: Strip and group names are always converted to lowercase in
# the code.
